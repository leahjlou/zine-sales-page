# HODL KOMBAT: The Zine

A digital zine celebrating the diversity and unity of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

In a world dominated by centralized financial institutions, a new hope emerges from the depths of the blockchain...

Set in the dystopian "Simple Town" where rampant inflation and government interference have led to the collapse of Big Bank-a-Tron, leaving citizens' wealth in jeopardy. Bitcoin locked in the Strategic Reserve is trapped behind an army of intermediaries. New champions emerge to combat centralization and return control to the people through a grand tournament.
